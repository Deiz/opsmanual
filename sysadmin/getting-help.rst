Getting help
============

It's important you know how to request support from the Open Knowledge
Foundation's sysadmin team. If your support request is made through the right
channels with the right information included, it will get dealt with much more
quickly than if it is not.

If you work for Open Knowledge Foundation Ltd.
----------------------------------------------

If you work for the Open Knowledge Foundation Ltd. (AKA "OKF Central") you
should email sysadmin@okfn.org.

Please see below for a request template.

If you do NOT work for Open Knowledge Foundation Ltd.
-----------------------------------------------------

If you are affiliated with the Open Knowledge Foundation community (our Local
Groups, Working Groups, Chapters, or similar) you should, in the first instance,
email sysadmin@community.okfn.org.

Please see below for a request template.

How to write a good support request
-----------------------------------

No matter who you contact in the first instance, you are much more likely to get
a timely and helpful response if you ensure that you provide the **right amount
of information** when submitting your request.

If you don't give us enough information, it make take a long chain of
back-and-forth emails to understand what needs to be done. Given that system
administrators tend to attend to support emails in short bursts between actually
processing requests, this could dramatically extend the amount of time required
to process your request.

That said, if you give us your entire life history, current emotional state, and
the details of your pet's dietary requirements, we may find it difficult to
parse your request for the relevant information.

In particular, **it's important that you make the following clear** in your
request:

#.  Who you are and what project or group (if any) you represent,
#.  What you would like the sysadmin team to do,
#.  Any deadline for processing your request.

If you are requesting something which has non-trivial costs associated with it,
please ensure you include the name of someone authorized to sign off on such
requests, such as a Unit Head.

If you are reporting an outage or a technical problem, please also make clear:

#.  What you did or tried to do, in enough detail to be able to reproduce the
    problem.
#.  What you expected to happen.
#.  What happened instead. Include any relevant logs or screenshots.

You may find the following template useful when submitting your request::

You may of course omit any fields you do not see as relevant for your request.
