Onboarding a sysadmin
=====================

Things that need doing when a new sysadmin comes on board:

- reencrypt credentials repo with their GPG key
- add to sysadmin group and run ansible across all machines
- WPEngine:
  - my.wpengine.com account
  - superadmin privileges on the blogfarm
- add to sysadmin-team in Google Groups
