Making changes to a ticket through the web interface
====================================================

If you have an account on rt.okfn.org then there are a lot of extra things you can do to a ticket.  It's possible to merge tickets, link them together, set reminders.  As well as changing the owner, queue and priority.

It's not possible to delete a reply or a comment.  So please be careful when replying to a ticket, as once you've replied, that reply is there for ever.  Never say anything on RT that you wouldn't want the requestor to read.

History
-------
RT records every action on a ticket and you can view the full trail of actions in the history section.  This is useful to track how much time people have been working on a ticket or what actions have been taken on a ticket.  You probably won't use it often, but it's very useful when you do.  

Basics
------
You'll use the basics section quite a lot and it's quite straightfoward.  This is where you change the owner, queue, subject, status, priority and a few other things.  You can use the priority field however you want to, but it's worth discussing how you want to use it within your team and sticking to it.  Obviously it's a handy way of prioritising work.  If the request is urgent, then give it a 5.  If it's something you'd like to do, but isn't that crucial, give it a 3.  As long as you and your team are consistent, then this can be a really useful way of managing your workload.



Links
-----
The links section (top right hand corner of the UI) is where you can merge tickets.  You can also link tickets up in two ways.

If you want to merge a ticket, simply add the ID of the ticket and save.  This cannot be undone, so make sure you're merging the right two tickets.  

There are quite a few ways to link tickets together, but the most useful is probably 'Refers to' which simply says the ticket refers to another ticket.  If you're not sure about how this works, feel free to log a couple of test tickets and link them up.

Jumbo
-----
Jumbo displays everything so if you have multiple changes to various parts of a ticket, this is useful.  But it can contain a lot of information.  

Reminders
---------
You can set a reminder to remind you to check on a ticket on a certain day.  This is a really useful feature and well worth using.  If someone has a request they want done on a specific day, just set a reminder for that day and RT will remind you on the day.
