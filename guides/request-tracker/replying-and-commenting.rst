Replying and Commenting
=======================

There are two ways to add your input to a call.  Replying and commenting.  When you reply to a ticket, that reply is emailed to the requestor and all others CCed or AdminCCed into a call.  If you add a comment onto a ticket it is not emailed out to everyone.  It is possible to see who's been sent a reply by lookint at the 'Show Email' link on the reply/comment on the ticket in the web interface.

If you email a ticket, that is always added as a reply.  So your email will go to everyone on the ticket.  

It is important that you understand the difference and also that it isn't possible to delete a reply or comment.  So before you reply, make sure you're happy with everyone seeing the reply and that you can't remove it afterwards.
