How to log a ticket via email
-----------------------------

Currently the sysadmin and finance teams use RT.  To log a call with the sysadmin team use the following email address:

sysadmin@okfn.org

To log a ticket with the finance team, please email:

payments@okfn.org

You will recieve an automatic email from RT.  This will contain your ticket ID.  If you reply to this email it will update your ticket.  RT knows how to file your reply by the subject.  So it is important that you do not change the subject.  The key part of the subject is this:

 [sysadmin #112233] 

If you do not have the part between [ and ] then RT will create a new ticket.  This can be confusing if someone has cced sysadmin@okfn.org in (for information) and then when you hit reply all, you don't have the right subject and RT creates another ticket.  If you do not have a reque
st, please do not email sysadmin@okfn.org, as it goes directly into RT.  If you know a ticket has been created, sending an email with the right ID into RT will file the response in the right place.

An example of a subject for payments would be:

[[payments@okf] #12246]
