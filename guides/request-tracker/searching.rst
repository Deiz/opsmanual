Searching for tickets
=====================

If you know the number of the ticket, this is really easy, just put that into the search box which is on all pages.  If you put 'fulltext:some text' in this box, RT will do a full text search of all tickets.  

If you want something a bit more complex, there is the Advanced Search page, which will allow you to search in great detail for tickets.  Here is a short overview of what is possible.  It's worth spending a little bit of time learning how to search for tickets as it's a very flexible and powerful interface. 

To get to the advanced search interface click, Search > Tickets > New Search.

Once you're on the page, here's a quick overview of it.  On the left, you've got the search criteria.  On the right you have the details of the search that you've built.  Below the current search box, there is a 'Saved searches' box which can be used to save specific searches and load saved searches, which can save you a lot of time.  At the bottom on the left you can set the sort options for the search.  On the bottom left you can select the display columns of the search.

The section where you build your search is the Add Criteria area.  As you can see, you can search by a large list of criteria.  If you know that the tickets you want are from bob@okfn.org and they are in the payments queue, you simply put Queue 'is' Payments in that dropdown.  Then in the Requestor Email 'is' bob@okfn.org, then click 'Add these terms and search'.  

Saving a search
---------------

Once you've got a query you're happy with, you can save it.  Simply go to the Saved searches section, set the privacy (if it's just for you leave on 'My saved searches'), but if you want something others can use, select the right area.  Fill in the description and click save.

To use a saved search, just go to 'Load saved search' and select the search you want and click load.  Then click the search button in bottom right.
