Dashboards
==========

Dashboards are a useful way of setting up a page either for yourself or your team which shows a specific subset of tickets.  If you want a specific dashboard send a ticket into the sysadmin team with the following information: 

 - Name of the dashboard
 - Tickets you want in the dashboard
 - Which group the dashboard is for

There is a lot of extra useful information about dashboards on the RT website:
