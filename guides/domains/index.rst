Requesting a Domain
=============================================

To request a new domain from the sysadmin team, please send an email into sysadmin@okfn.org with the following details:

-  Name(s) of domain(s) required
-  How long you want to register the domain for (default, 1 year)
-  Does the domain need to be set to auto-renew
-  Who is the owner of the domain (so we know who to ask about renewal)
-  If this is for a specific project

Auto-renew means that the domain will be automatically renewed when it comes up for renewal for a year.  If you want to keep the domain, say yes.  Otherwise we'll assume you don't want it to auto-renew.

If we don't know who to ask about a domain and it's not set to auto-renew the domain will normally be allowed to expire, so if you don't want that to happen, please tell us.  A reasonable number of the domains that are registered are never actually used, so if a domain hasn't been used in a year and we've not been asked to auto-renew it, we won't.
