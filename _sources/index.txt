Welcome to the Ops Manual
=========================

Welcome. This is the Open Knowledge Foundation Operations Manual, where you
will find documentation and advice on how the Open Knowledge Foundation (Open
Knowledge Foundation) operates. While primarily intended to be used by Open
Knowledge Foundation staff, the content here may also be useful for those
affiliated with the Open Knowledge Foundation's Working and Local Groups, as
well as our broader community.

.. note::

   The Operations Manual is new, and content is still being migrated from its
   various previous homes (Google Drive, the Open Knowledge Foundation wiki,
   peoples' heads). Please bear with us while we get the manual up to scratch.
