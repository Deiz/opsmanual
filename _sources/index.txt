OKF Operations Manual
=====================

Welcome. This is the OKF Operations Manual, where you will find documentation
and advice on how the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) operates. While primarily
intended to be used by OKF staff, the content here may also be useful for those
affiliated with the OKF's Working and Local Groups, as well as our broader
community.

.. note::

   The Operations Manual is new, and content is still being migrated from its
   various previous homes (Google Drive, the OKFN wiki, peoples' heads). Please
   bear with us while we get the manual up to scratch.

What is this?
=============

The web pages you're viewing are maintained as a Sphinx_ project on `GitHub`_.
Anyone with appropriate permissions on GitHub can edit the content, and there is
a short guide to getting started:
