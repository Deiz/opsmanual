Email alias management
======================

Introduction
------------

This document contains a description of how to manage our large set of email
domains and aliases. **Members of the coordination team** (management + unit
heads), as well as the sysadmin team, can edit aliases through the interface at
FastMail, our front-line email provider.

How to add an email alias
-------------------------

#. Visit the `FastMail Virtual Domains configuration page <fm-config_>`_ (log in
   from LastPass)

   .. _fm-config: https://www.fastmail.fm/html/?MSS=!SE-*&MSignal=VD-*&u=a864411d

#. Fill out the form as shown below. For this example, we are adding an alias so
   that joe.bloggs@gmail.com receives mail sent to joe.bloggs@okfn.org. Please
   ensure that the penultimate checkbox (“SRS”) is checked as shown below.

   the following at the top of the page:

#. If the domain you wish to receive email at is not in the dropdown list,
   please submit your request to sysadmin@okfn.org.

How to remove an email alias
----------------------------

#. Visit the `FastMail Virtual Domains configuration page <fm-config_>`_ (log in
   from LastPass)

#. Use the search box to find the alias. NB: enter only the username part of the
   email address. That is, if you wish to delete joe.bloggs@okfn.org, just
   search for “joe.bloggs”.

#. Click the “Del” button on the right hand side of the row containing the alias
   you wish to delete. You will see a confirmation similar to that shown above
   for alias creation.
