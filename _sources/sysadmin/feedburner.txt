We use Feedburner for managing some of our blog feeds and for providing
"subscribe via email" options on our blogs.

Access
======

Use admin [at] okfn [dot] org email.

Customization
=============

Email
-----

Recommend customizing the email. By default every email for subscribers
will have the same title of the name of your weblog. This isn't very
useful. To change this:

#. Login to Feedburner
#. Click on the Publicize Tab
#. Choose Email Subscriptions from the left navigation menu
#. Click on Email Branding sub menu
#. Now you have the option to change the email title.
#. Change the feedburner email subject / title as required. Adding
   ${latestItemTitle} in the title will replace it with your Posts title
#. Scroll down and click Save.

Also worth adding our logo:
